deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-net --allow-run bundle.ts 

Also, you can run the script without bundling using 

deno run --allow-read deno/main.ts ../eng.traineddata ../../../output.sup outline


Just keep in mind that it's going to pull worker.js from build/deno/pgs-to-srt, so make sure to dump a bundled worker.js in there before trying to run it.
