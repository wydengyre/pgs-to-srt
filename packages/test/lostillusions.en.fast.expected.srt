1
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,458
For Lucien,

2
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,250
it all began with ink,

3
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:15,208
paper and the love of beauty.

4
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:21,125
LOST ILLUSIONS

5
00:02:39,83 --> 00:02:41,458
Orphaned and destitute,
he was obliged

6
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,542
to learn a trade to survive.

7
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:49,00
His sister Eve had married
an Angouléme printer

8
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,292
and he worked
in their modest shop,

9
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,500
dreaming of another life.

10
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,958
THE MARGUERITES
POEMS

11
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,667
Even today in Paris,

12
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:16,458
people wonder how
his story could have happened,

13
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,250
what movement of the world
swept him away.

14
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:28,917
Here.

15
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
- I'll be late.
- No, you won't.

16
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,208
They won't eat you alive.

17
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:58,833
But for now, this long alleyway

18
00:03:59,00 --> 00:04:02,417
transported him to a new world,
almost another country...

19
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:06,500
All the way to
Madam de Bargeton's chateau.

20
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,917
The guests are arriving, My Lady.

21
00:04:21,83 --> 00:04:22,167
Thank you.

22
00:04:24,00 --> 00:04:27,500
Enduring a husband
almost as old as her chateau,

23
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:31,83
she considered herself
a patroness of the arts.

24
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,708
One Sunday after mass,

25
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:37,667
the bishop spoke of a young poet,
a worker at a printer's,

26
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,542
who went by the prestigious name
of Lucien de Rubempré.

27
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,292
The most difficult

28
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,708
is to render
the vitality of the petals.

29
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,792
You see the eglantines?

30
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:44,500
Please leave.

31
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,583
For her.

32
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,708
Thank you, Lucien.

33
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,875
This is a great honor.

34
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,125
| feared you might not come.

35
00:06:13,83 --> 00:06:14,333
Your husband's here?

36
00:06:16,00 --> 00:06:17,292
Don't be silly.

37
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:22,83
He only reads hunting treatises
and plays with his dogs.

38
00:06:26,42 --> 00:06:27,833
You're very beautiful, madam.

39
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,167
My dear friends,

40
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:37,125
| thank you for your loyal presence.

41
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,917
One day perhaps,
our protégé will be recognized

42
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,125
and famous,

43
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,208
and we shall be able to say:
"| knew him,

44
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,792
and his work moved me."

45
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:52,875
Last month, our young poet read us
a magnificent biblical poem.

46
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:55,958
Our gazette
hailed him in glowing terms:

47
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,00
"When dazzling talent
emerges in a great youth,

48
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:01,958
"it is fresh hope for us all.

49
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,458
"A new springtime in one's life.

50
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,83
"Only 20,
but the force of an artist."

51
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,250
For him, poetry is holy,

52
00:07:11,00 --> 00:07:13,42
almost a personal religion.

53
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:18,83
One can only revere minds
in whom God has placed His light.

54
00:07:19,83 --> 00:07:20,625
Sir, we are waiting.

55
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,583
Your satchel, it's unbecoming.

56
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,542
For her.

57
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,708
Love,

58
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:44,958
prayer

59
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,375
and song,

60
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,625
to me existence gave.

61
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:53,167
Of all the earthly good
that mortals crave,

62
00:07:54,42 --> 00:07:57,208
In this my farewell hour
| nought regret.

63
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,208
Nought, save the burning sighs

64
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,125
that soar above,

65
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,917
The lyre's full ecstasy,
or wordless love

66
00:08:06,83 --> 00:08:08,875
Of hearts that ne'er forget.

67
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:14,167
To sweep the lyre
at listening beauty's feet,

68
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:17,333
To mark from note to note
the transport sweet,

69
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,625
Thrill her rapt bosom

70
00:08:19,83 --> 00:08:20,833
with responsive power

71
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,125
To draw tears of rapture
from her eyes

72
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,250
As morning dews are swept

73
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,458
by zephyrs' sighs
From the full, bending flower.

74
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,42
Forgive me.

75
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:02,458
They have narrow lives,
they feel nothing.

76
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,42
It was very beautiful.

77
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:13,292
Excuse me.

78
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,542
Marquise de Contades
wishes to thank you, madam.

79
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,417
What do you expect from them?

80
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,292
And you?

81
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,458
What did you think?

82
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,333
One does not think these things,
one feels them, right?

83
00:09:46,00 --> 00:09:47,208
Louise.

84
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,167
Such a love
as you have made me feel,

85
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,42
| thought both utopic and forbidden.

86
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:54,708
Forbidden,

87
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,208
like all which
must in the end triumph.

88
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,458
Each word
brings your lips closer,

89
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,542
each book | read
seems to speak of you.

90
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:15,458
Since this dreadful afternoon,
I've thought only of you.

91
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:19,417
Of you, alone in the shadows
of those lifeless walls,

92
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,333
loveless and without poesy.

93
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:24,292
Nothing but love

94
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,83
matters in this world.

95
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,500
And love is like the wind...

96
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,667
it will carry us away.

97
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,00
For you, Louise,

98
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:37,375
Lucien.

99
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,250
She took irrational risks to meet him,

100
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:49,708
inventing reasons to run off.
